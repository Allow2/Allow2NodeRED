# Allow2 Node-RED Client Nodes

## Overview

The Node-RED Allow2 contribution package enables the development of flows in
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) which connect to the
[Allow2](http://www.allow2.com)
parental freedom platform for the purposes of controlling device access for children.

Adding parental freedom is about increasing your addressable demographic, it is NOT about reducing users!

Let's remove the hurdles for parents together and increase global accessibility to the latest and greatest technologies and services.

## Documentation

See the [Project Documentation and Rationale](https://allow2.github.io/)
for an overview of the Allow2 platform.

See the [Allow2Node client library](https://github.com/Allow2/Allow2node)
github project for javascript-based API documentation.
